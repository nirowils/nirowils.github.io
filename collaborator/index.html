		  	<p><br>Gordon is a Senior Research Fellow in the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St Andrews. I worked in collaboration with Gordon during my master's thesis which focussed on investigating the baseline spatial and temporal dive behaviours of harbor seal <i>(Phoca vitulina)</i> off the coast of the UK. The long-term scope of this project is to use this information in congruence with future harbor seal dive data to determine the impacts of offshore wind farm development that is scheduled for development within the next decade.<br><br><br></p>

		  	<p><br>Ari is the Principal Investigator in the Biotelemetry and Behavioral Ecology Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). I carried out an independent research project in Ari's group which involved the development of a novel methodology for quantifying sea-ice concentrations that Antarctic minke whales <i>(Balaenoptera bonaerensis)</i> occupy using remote-sensed animal-borne video footage. During my time in this group I also gained extensive field and scientific communication experience.<br><br><br></p>

		  	<p><br>Colleen is the Principal Investigator in the Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Lab at UCSC. I served as a research technician in Colleen's lab working in project development, data collection and data analysis for nearly two years throughout my undergradute degree. This was my first hands-on introduction to marine mammal science which inspired me to pursue this field as a career.<br><br><br></p>
