		  	<p><br>Gordon is a Senior Research Fellow in the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St Andrews. I worked in collaboration with Gordon on my master's thesis which focussed on investigating the baseline spatial and temporal dive behaviours of harbor seal <i>(Phoca vitulina)</i> off the coast of the UK. The long-term scope of this project is to use this information in congruence with future harbor seal dive data to determine the impacts of offshore wind farm development that is scheduled for development within the next decade.<br><br><br></p>

		  	<p><br>Philine is a group leader at Eawag (Switzerland). I carried out my PhD work as part of Philine's group which involved the production of new resources for Alpine whitefish <i>Coregonus</i> spp. and a large whole-genome re-sequencing project to investigate the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation across the Alpine whitefish radiation.<br><br><br></p>

I am currently collaborating on a QTL mapping project with Cam (as well as other members and ex-members of the <a href="https://homepages.eawag.ch/~matthebl/research.html">Matthews lab</a>) where we aim to understand the genetic basis of key foraging traits in stickleback.<br><br><br></p>

		  	<p><br>Vincent is a professor at Imperial College London. I worked in Vincent's lab during my bachelor's and master's degrees. The most substantial proportion of this work involved working on the <i>Howea</i> palm system on Lord Howe island. This project aimed to understand the role of soil bacteria and fungi in promoting or facilitating sympatric speciation of <i>Howea</i> palms.<br><br><br></p>
