			<p>Hello, I'm Nicole - I am an environmental consultant with expertise in marine biology and ecosystem-based management.
			<p><u><strong>Interests</strong></u>: My interests and expertise lie in the overlap between human activities and non-human (mammals, birds, fishes) habitat use of aquatic environments. My aim is to provide innovative, robust, and scientifically sound solutions for anthropogenic concerns relating to the marine environment.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/pics/pic1.JPG" width="600" height="406" class="center">
			<p><u><strong>Previous Work</strong></u>: My previous work has revolved around understanding how anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., pollution, noise, climate change, ect.) in the marine environment impact marine mammals.</p>
			<p><strong>MSc Dissertation: Hastie Lab - University of St Andrews, UK</strong>
			During my master’s thesis I undertook an independent investigation into the spatial and temporal drivers of harbor seal diving behavior. I was responsible for planning the project with input from collaborators, undertaking all statistical analyses of the data, and writing up the work in the form of a publication-quality manuscript. As part of the project, I developed my skills in statistical modelling, and the analysis of spatial and geographic data analysis (using R). I also put my knowledge of holistic management strategies and working with a diverse array of stakeholders (i.e., industry, researchers, conservationists, and politicians) into practice.</p>
			<p><strong>Research Technician: Friedlaender Biotelemetry and Behavioral Ecology Lab - UC Santa Cruz</strong>
			This project aimed to understand the behavior of Antarctic minke whales, specifically with regards to their distribution and movement patterns in ice-covered habitats. In my role as a research technician, I carried out fieldwork, involving the tracking, tagging, and monitoring of whales, and the subsequent analysis of large datasets comprising video footage of whale behavior. I published this work with my collaborators as a scientific journal article and presented my findings in the form of a talk at the 2019 World Marine Mammal Conference in Barcelona, Spain. The collaborative nature of this project helped develop my project planning, organizational, and interpersonal skills. I also acquired more technical experience analyzing and processing data and honed my writing and presenting skills during the publication process.</p>
			<p><strong>Research Technician: Reichmuth Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Lab - UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
			<p>My work in the Reichmuth lab spanned multiple projects orientated around understanding the ecology and physiology of pinnipeds (1 ringed seal, 1 bearded seal, 1 harbor seal, 2 California sea lions). As part of a large collaborative team, I was responsible for essential tasks such as animal husbandry, data collection, and data analysis. I also carried out fieldwork that included handling, tagging, and monitoring of Northern elephant seal weanlings at Año Nuevo State Park. This opportunity allowed me to understand the intricacies of working in the field and in contact with wild and captive animals, as well as fostered my professional communication skills. </p>
